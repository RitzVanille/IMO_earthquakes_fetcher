# Easy retrival of the Iceland Meteorological Office eqrthquake catalogue 

The [IMO](https://vedur.is/) curates the earthquake bulletin for Iceland with the SIL catalogue (South Iceland Lowland, extended to the whole country since).

## Data coverage

1994-present, archived weekly

## Usage

The script can be ran directly by using:
```
python3 get_IMO_earthquakes.py
```
If you want to change the name of the output file, you can do so by altering the variable called `CATALOGUE_FILE_NAME` inside the script.

## Dependencies

This script needs the python [`requests` package](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) to run.
If the package is not already installed on your system, you can install it in a virtual environment 
1. Create virtual environment (for example by storing the venv as a `.venv`)
```
python3 -m venv <PathToVenv>
```
2. activate it 
```
source <PathToVenv>/bin/activate
```
3. Install needed packages:
```
pip3 install requests 
```

The virtual environment is now set up and you can activate it before running the script with the command: 
```
source <PathToVenv>/bin/activate
```
